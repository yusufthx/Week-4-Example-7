# Week-4-Example-7 (Blinking LEDs)
There are two LEDs whose anodes are connected to pin 0 and pin 1 respectively of the microcontroller board. 
The LED1 (in this project we chose was yellow LED) needs to be flashing with ON time 750ms and OFF time 350ms.
The LED2 needs to be flashing with ON time 400 and OFF time 600ms.

Hi everyone, this is a quick and simple tutorial on how to make a blink LED (different flashing rate) using Arduino UNO and LEDs.

It is very good for beginners to learn about LED blinking using microcontroller such as Arduino UNO.

Parts needed:

1x Any microcontroller board (UNO)

1x Solderless Breadboard

2x LEDs (any color)

3x Wires (Male-to-male jumper)
