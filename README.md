There are two LEDs whose anodes are connected to PB0 and PB1 respectively. The LED1 needs to be flashing with ON time 750ms and OFF time 350ms.
The LED2 needs to be flashing with ON time 400 and OFF time 600ms.

Hi everyone, this is a quick and simple tutorial on how to make a blink LED (different flashing rate) using Arduino UNO and LEDs.

It is very good for beginners to learn about LED blinking using Arduino.

Parts needed:

1x Arduino (UNO)

1x Solderless Breadboard

2x LEDs

3x Wires (Male-to-male jumper)
